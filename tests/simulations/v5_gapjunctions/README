scx-v5-gapjunctions
===================

This neurodamus blueconfig is extracted from a real use case and uses the
following advanced features:
 * GapJunctions
 * Projections
 * Synapse Replay
 *   - With Delay


SETUP
=====

We searched for a minimal setup where two cells had a GJ and one of them received projections
used in the replay.

SONATA circuit
------------
Based on the official /gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/project/proj1/circuits/SomatosensoryCxS1-v5.r0/O1-sonata/sonata/circuit_config.json
and a few patches from /gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/project/proj12/jenkins/cellular/circuit-scx-v5-gapjunctions/sonata_circuit,
see (/gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/project/proj12/jenkins/cellular/circuit-scx-v5-gapjunctions/sonata_circuit/READ)

SONATA sub_mini2 circuit
------------------------
This local subcircuit is extracted from the v5_sonata SONATA circuit for the node_set "mini2" using brainbuilder:
    brainbuilder sonata split-subcircuit --circuit circuit_config.json --nodeset mini5 --output sub_mini2 --include-virtual --create-external
The source population in the external edges file "external_default.h5" is modified manually from "default" to "external_default" in order to offset the external node ids.

The "morphologies" folder is extracted from "/gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/release/l2/data/morphologies/31.05.12/ascii/".
The "biophysical_model_templates" folder is extracted from "/gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/project/proj1/circuits/SomatosensoryCxS1-v5.r0/O1-sonata/sonata/components/biophysical_model_templates".
