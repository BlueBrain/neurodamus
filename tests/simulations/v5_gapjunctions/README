scx-v5-gapjunctions
===================

This neurodamus blueconfig is extracted from a real use case and uses the
following advanced features:
 * GapJunctions
 * Projections
 * Synapse Replay
 *   - With Delay


SETUP
=====

We searched for a minimal setup where two cells had a GJ and one of them received projections
used in the replay.

                      (GJ)
      cells  ->  74188 <-> 74051
projections  ->

Source Cells
------------
$ h5ls -r /gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/project/proj1/circuits/SomatosensoryCxS1-v5.r0/O1/merged_circuit/ncsFunctionalAllRecipePathways/nrn.h5 | grep a74188
/a74188                  Dataset {1217, 19}

Gap Junctions
-------------
>>> f = h5py.File("gap_junctions/gj.syn2")
>>> res = f["synapses/default/properties/connected_neurons_pre"][:]
>>> f["synapses/default/properties/connected_neurons_post"][numpy.where(res == 74188-1)]
# notice 74050 shows up a few times

Projections
-----------
$ h5ls /gpfs/bbp.cscs.ch/project/proj1/circuits/SomatosensoryCxS1-v5.r0/O1/merged_circuit/ncsThalamocortical_VPM_tcS2F_2p6_ps/proj_nrn.h5.5005 | grep 74188
a74188                   Dataset {103, 19}
