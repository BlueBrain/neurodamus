scx-v5-gapjunctions
===================

This neurodamus blueconfig is extracted from a real use case and uses the
following advanced features:
 * GapJunctions
 * Projections
 * Synapse Replay
 *   - With Delay


SETUP
=====

We searched for a minimal setup where two cells had a GJ and one of them received projections
used in the replay.

                      (GJ)
